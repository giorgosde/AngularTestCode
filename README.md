# AngularTestCode
This is a project to promote my skills on Angular4. Tried to use most known techniques like routing, emmiters, models, lifecycle hooks etc. 

Initial structured is based on Angular QuickStart: https://github.com/angular/quickstart

**1) git clone https://github.com/giorgosde/AngularTestCode.git
2) npm start**

_Tip: in case of breakdown:
