# AngularTestCode
This is a code sample (not a full project), in order to promote my skills on Angular4 - Typescript and front-end part in general. Tried to use most known techniques like routing, emmiters, models, http services, lifecycle hooks, conditional styling etc. 

__To run the project:__

1. npm install
2. npm start

Initial structure is based on Angular QuickStart: https://github.com/angular/quickstart

Thank you.
