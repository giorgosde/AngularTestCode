# AngularTestCode
This is a code sample (not a full project), in order to promote my skills on Angular4 - Typescript. Tried to use most known techniques like routing, emmiters, models, http services, lifecycle hooks etc. 

Initial structure is based on Angular QuickStart: https://github.com/angular/quickstart

__To run the project:__

1. git clone https://github.com/giorgosde/AngularTestCode.git
2. npm install
3. npm start

Thank you.
